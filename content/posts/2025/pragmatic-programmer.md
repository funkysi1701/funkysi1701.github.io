I have been reading the Pragmatic Programmer and I have to say it is a great book. It is full of great advice and tips for programmers. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a programmer at any level or wants to become one.

Here is the complete list of tips that can be found in the book, (I am reading the 20th anniversary edition, so these might be slightly different if you are looking at the original edition):

- Care About Your Craft
- Think! About Your Work
- You Have Agency
- Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses
- [Don’t Live with Broken Windows](/posts/2015/pragmatic-programmer-broken-windows/) I blogged about this in 2015
- Be a Catalyst for Change
- Remember the Big Picture
- Make Quality a Requirements Issue
- Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
- Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear
- English is Just Another Programming Language
- It’s Both What You Say and the Way You Say It
- Build Documentation In, Don’t Bolt It On
- Good Design is easier to change than bad design
- DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself
- Make it easy to reuse
- Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things
- There are no Final Decisions
- Forgo Following Fads
- Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target
- Prototype to Learn
- Program Close to the Problem Domain
- Estimate to Avoid Surprises
- Iterate the Schedule with the Code
- Keep Knowledge in Plain Text
- Use the Power of Command Shells
- Achieve Editor Fluency
- Always use version control
- Fix the Problem, Not the Blame
- Don’t Panic
- Failing tests before fixing code
- Read the damn error message
- "select" isn't broken
- Don't assume it - Prove it
- Learn a text manipulation language
- You can't write perfect software
- Design with contracts
- Crash early
- Use assertions to prevent the impossible
- Finish what you start
- Act Locally
- Take small steps - Always
- Avoid Fortune Telling
- Decoupled code is easy to change
- Tell, Don't Ask
- Don't chain method calls
- Avoid global data
- If it's important enough to be global, wrap it in an API
- Programming is about code, but programs are about data
- don't hoard state, pass it around
