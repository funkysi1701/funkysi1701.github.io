Stepping outside my comfort zone doesn’t come naturally to me. I’m happiest behind my laptop, but every now and then, I know it’s important to try something new. This year, my family and I decided to do just that—and it turned out to be one of our most memorable weeks ever. Curious about what happens when you swap routine for adventure? Read on!

## Introduction

This week was our family holiday. Normally, we’d book a cottage somewhere nice and explore at our own pace. But this often leads to disagreements—everyone wants something different, and sometimes the places we visit aren’t as exciting as we hoped (especially for two kids aged 7 and 9 who get bored easily).

This time, we chose a different path: a family adventure holiday with [High Adventure](https://www.highadventureholidays.co.uk/). The itinerary was packed: climbing, caving, hiking, water sports, archery, zip wires, and countless other activities. All meals, accommodation, equipment, and expert instructors were included, making it feel both safe and exciting.

I’ll admit, I was anxious before we set off. I’m not an adventurous person—I like [walking](/posts/2024/charity-hike), but I’d never tried anything like this. My nine-year-old son was dreading it, while my more adventurous seven-year-old was quietly excited. I worried that if the kids hated it, it would be a waste of money. But as soon as we arrived, those fears melted away.

## Saturday

We arrived on Saturday afternoon and were shown to our room. My only real complaint from the whole week: the room was tiny. With two bunk beds and four of us plus a week’s worth of clothes, it was a challenge to keep things tidy. Thankfully, the rest of the facility was spacious, and our room was right next to the games room—a bonus.

Dinner was served at 6pm every evening, always a home-cooked meal. While I enjoyed the food, my fussy eaters weren’t always convinced, but there was usually something for everyone. We met the other family we’d be doing activities with.

After dinner, we explored the Games Room and took on the Labyrinth—a tight, dark maze constructed under the floor. Helmets were required! I found it a bit tight, but my boys absolutely loved it.

## Sunday

Every day began with a cooked breakfast and a make-your-own sandwich station for lunch. Sunday morning kicked off with climbing and abseiling. I’d never climbed before, so I was surprised—and proud—to make it all the way to the top of the 8-meter wall. My boys didn’t quite reach the top, but they pushed themselves higher than I expected. Abseiling was fun too, and a great way to come down after the climb.

After lunch, we tried archery. I’d done it once before at my boys’ Scout group, but it took a while to hit the target consistently. Then came bushcraft: foraging for wood, using a knife to make kindling, and lighting a fire with a ferrocerium rod. My nine-year-old and I managed to get a fire going—definitely a memorable moment, especially when we roasted marshmallows.

The evening’s activity was Nightline: a blindfolded obstacle course. This was a bit much for me, but the boys loved it. My job was to guide them through the course, describing what to climb over, under, or through, and when to stop.

## Monday

Monday started with a walk up the hill to Wainman’s Pinnacle and some “weaseling” through the rocks—a favourite for the boys, especially since they’d done it before with Scouts. I skipped most of the weaseling but enjoyed the walk.

In the afternoon, it was time for high ropes and a zip wire. We were safely roped in at all times, but stepping off a high ledge still required a leap of faith. My eldest was nervous and had to climb down at first, but after watching me try, he gave it another go—and loved it. That’s what this week was about: encouraging all of us to try new things.

The evening activity was Eggbert: designing a contraption to protect an egg dropped from a height. We worked as a family, but failed to consider that the weight would flip the egg so it landed the wrong way up. Oops! We didn’t win, but it was great fun seeing everyone’s creative designs.

## Tuesday

Tuesday was our first full day offsite. The instructors drove us in a minibus to the Yorkshire Three Peaks area, where we explored underground caves. Wearing cave suits, wellies, and helmets, we were ready for adventure. I foolishly thought I wouldn’t need a change of clothes—turns out, crawling through water-filled tunnels means your wellies fill up fast! I wasn’t the biggest fan of being soaked, but the boys loved climbing and sliding through the narrow passages. We finished the day with ice cream and hot chocolate in Settle—a well-deserved treat.

That evening, we tried circus skills and gathered around a campfire. The boys were entertained for ages, trying juggling and balance activities. I didn’t master anything, but I enjoyed relaxing by the fire with my wife and the other parents.

## Wednesday

By Wednesday, tiredness was catching up with me! We tackled a five-mile walk around Malham Cove, taking in stunning views and great weather. The route included Gordale Scar and Janet’s Foss, a lovely waterfall where many people swam or paddled. We hadn’t brought towels, but that didn’t stop my boys from getting soaked. It’s a holiday—why not?

Wednesday evening was supposed to be a parents’ night off, but we had to cut it short due to a family emergency.

## Thursday

Thursday was water sports day, but we decided on a quieter option and visited Haworth instead. The town is famous for the Brontë sisters, and we enjoyed its picturesque streets, a museum, and a play area for the kids—a great way to wind down after so much activity.

The final evening was a quiz night, complete with questions about the week’s adventures.

## Friday

Friday was going-home day, but not before one last challenge: orienteering. As a former university orienteering club member, I couldn’t resist joining in!

## Conclusion

This week was truly about stepping outside my comfort zone and embracing new experiences. From climbing and caving to bushcraft and zip lines, every activity challenged me and helped me grow. I discovered that pushing your boundaries can be both exciting and rewarding—and creates memories that last a lifetime. If you ever get the chance to try something new, even if it feels a bit daunting, I highly recommend taking the leap. You might just surprise yourself!
