My comfort zone is in front of my laptop tapping away on its keyboard. However, it is very helpful to occasionally step outside and experience the world. This post doesn't feature much tech and is a personal story of my holiday, feel free to skip over it if this doesn't interest you.

## Introduction

This week was our family holiday, our usual plan is to book a cottage somewhere nice, and then explore in our own time. This sometimes results in arguments as everyone wants something different, or the places we visit are not as interesting as we expected, especially if you are 7 or 9 and get bored easily.

This holiday was different and was action-packed. We booked a family adventure holiday from [High Adventure](https://www.highadventureholidays.co.uk/), which featured climbing, caving, walking, water sports, archery, zip wires and many other organised activities. All meals and accommodation were included, as well as equipment and expert instructors to keep us safe while doing all these new things.

Before the holiday there was a certain amount of anxiety about the holiday. I am not an adventurous person, I like [walking](/charity-hike) but have never done anything like this before, my nine-year-old son was dreading the holiday, while my more adventurous seven-year-old was quietly looking forward to it. If my children hated it and didn't engage with the activities I could see this holiday being a huge waste of money. Once we got to the holiday these fears quickly vanished as we got stuck in.

## Saturday

We arrived on Saturday afternoon and we were shown to our room. My only complaint from the whole week is that the room was very small, two bunk beds so with four of us and a week's worth of clothes it was hard to keep it tidy and not trip over each other. However, the rest of the place had lots of space and our room was next to the games room so it was a nice location.

Dinner was at 6pm every day and was a home cooked meal. I liked the food, however my fussy eating children were less keen, but there was usually at least something they would eat. We met the other family that would be doing the same activities as us.

After dinner we went back to the Games Room for Labyrinth. This was a tight maze constructed under the floor. It was dark and we had to wear helmets. The whole family had a go, I was less keen on this activity as was very tight and hard to manoeuvre but my boys loved it.

## Sunday

Sunday started with a cooked breakfast (everyday started this way), and a station to make sandwiches for lunch. In the morning we had a climbing and abseiling session. I had never done climbing before, so I surprised myself at how well I did, I climbed all the way to the top of the 8m climbing wall. Really pleased with myself. My boys didn't quite reach the top, but they pushed themselves high up the wall. Abseiling was also fun, but very similar to coming down from the climbing.

After lunch it was time to do Archery. I had tried this before at an event at my boys Scout Group, so I was familiar with it, but it took me a fair few arrows to start getting them in the target.

After that it was time for Bushcraft. Bushcraft is the use of skills to survive and thrive in a natural environment. We went foraging for wood to start a fire, used a knife to create kindling, used a ferrocerium rod to create sparks to light the fire. Me and the 9 year old eventually got a fire going, so I call that a success and very memoriable for the boys. Especially the eating marshmallows roasted on the fire.

After dinner we did an activity called Nightline. This was a blindfolded obstacle course. This was too much for me, but our boys loved it. I had the difficult job of describing the route, what to climb over/under/through and when to stop to avoid colliding with other parents and children.

## Monday

Monday started with a local walk up the hill to Wainman's Pinnacle and some squirreling through the rocks. Squirreling is something the boys loved, especially as they have done it before with their scout group. I didn't do much of the squirreling but I did enjoy the walk.

In the afternoon it was time for High ropes and Zip wire. This was great fun, very similar to the climbing. We were roped in at all times so no danger of falling however, there is a certain amount of faith required when you step off a high ledge either to use the zip wire or one of the other high activities. My eldest let fear get the better of him, and had to climb down, however later he faced his fear after seeing me do it, and loved it. This is what the week was all about, encouraging my boys (and me) to do things they never have before.

The evenings activity was called Eggbert, and was all about designing a constuction to save an egg being dropped off a high point. We worked as a family on this, and completely failed to consider that the weight of the egg would flip our construction over so it landed egg first not balloon first. We may have failed but it was great fun seeing all the elaborate ways the different families had built to save their egg.

## Tuesday

Tuesday was the first day we spent all day off site. The instructors drove us in a minibus to the Yorkshire three peaks where they were underground caves. We were suited up in cave suits, wellies and helmets with head torches. We were advised to bring a change of clothes for this trip, I didn't think I would need it, I was so wrong. There was a lot of water in the caves which was fine, until the roof got so low you had to crawl, when you are crawling through water, it goes right into your wellies, and you spend the rest of the cave trip with water in them. I may not have been a huge fan of this, but the boys loved it. Climbing/Sliding through the small gaps, getting completely wet in the process. After caving we stopped at Settle for Ice Cream and Hot Chocolate, very well deserved after out caving trip.

The evening activity was Circus Skills and a Camp Fire. This entertain my boys for ages as they tried the different juggling and balance activities, I had a go but didn't master anything. I did enjoy sitting with the wife and other parents around the camp fire.

## Wednesday

Tiredness from all these activities was beginning to hit me by Wednesday, which was a 5 mile walk around Malham Cove. The walk started at Malham Cove, then onto Gordale Scar and then onto Janet's Foss and back to the minibus. The views on the walk were glorious, and the weather stayed nice so no need for all the waterproofs. Janet's Foss was a lovely waterfall where many had an outside swim or paddle. We didn't intend on getting wet so we didn't bring a towel, my boys didn't get the memo and got far wetter than I would have liked. But we are on holiday, so its all good fun.  

Wednesday evening was the parents night off, unfortunately a family emergency meant we had to cut this short.

## Thursday

Thursday was the water sports day. We decided to give this a miss, and have a quieter day. We took a trip to the small town of Haworth. There is a museum about the Brontë sisters, a very picturesque town, a play area for the kids, so a great place for a quiet last day.

The last evening activity was a quiz, fun even had a round of questions about the weeks adventures.

## Friday

Friday was the going home day, but before we left there was an orienteering activity. As a former member of the Orienteeting Club at University I had to take part.

## Conclusion

This week was all about stepping outside my comfort zone and trying new things. From climbing and caving to bushcraft and zip lines, each activity challenged me in different ways and helped me grow. I discovered that pushing my boundaries can be both exciting and rewarding, and I made memories that will last a lifetime. If you ever get the chance to try something new—even if it feels a bit daunting at first—I highly recommend taking that leap. You might surprise yourself with what you can achieve!
