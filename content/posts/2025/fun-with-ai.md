## Fun with AI

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) has some new features for creating images, and I thought it would be fun to see what it could do with a picture of me.

I used the following prompt:

```txt
Draw an action figure toy of the person in this photo. The action figure should be full-figure 
and displayed in its original blister pack packaging. On top of the box is the name of the toy 
"Software Developer" across a single line of text. In the blister pack packaging, next to the figure, 
show the toy's accessories, including a Microsoft laptop, cup of coffee, the Visual Studio app, 
GitHub app, and the Azure app. There should be a label on the corner of the box that says 
"Limited Edition". This figure should look like a premium toy and everything should be inside 
the plastic!
```

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" >
  <tr style="border-width:0px 0px 0px 0px">
    <td style="border-width:0px 0px 0px 0px">
      and I supplied the following image:
    </td>
    <td style="border-width:0px 0px 0px 0px">
      and this is the result:
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr style="border-width:0px 0px 0px 0px">
    <td style="border-width:0px 0px 0px 0px">
      <img src="/images/ndc-simon.jpg" alt="A picture of me" width="300" height="400" class="img-fluid" />
    </td>
    <td style="border-width:0px 0px 0px 0px">
      <img src="/images/ai-version-of-me.png" alt="AI version of me" width="300" height="400" class="img-fluid" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Pretty cool, right? Well I can't take the credit for the prompt, It comes from [Amy Ru](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amyru_out-of-all-the-chatgpt-image-generation-capabilities-activity-7312549043610521601-BPqJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAOBLj4B-Ls737kwBrHA1oRvkACb_CoRCQw2X0v1gk7q4r3w8Q9x5a6b0h4j2c1nqZz7g&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_primary%3B5JdYtG6mQeKx%2FfWl8V9jNQ%3D%3D) on LinkedIn.
