The periodic table lists all the chemical elements and groups them together based on some key properties. In 2016 I found an article about the [periodic table of DevOps](https://xebialabs.com/periodic-table-of-devops-tools/) and wrote a blog [post](/posts/2016/periodic-table-devops/) about it.

I thought it might be interesting to see what tools are still in use, and what are new.

| ---        | ---  | ---  | ---      |
