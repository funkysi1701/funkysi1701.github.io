Many years ago I spent a lot of time learning about electronics. It was great fun, I can’t remember specific things I built, but learning what resistors and capacitors do was fascinating.

I haven’t really thought about this much as my interests have been concentrated on computers and programming, but recently my interest has been peaked again.

The [CodeNewbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/) and [Hanselminutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) podcasts have been running a month of stuff about making things and doing clever things with hardware called [#Marchisformakers](http://marchisformakers.com/), this began to start me thinking about this stuff again.

Yesterday a friend of mine was showing me what he had been doing with a Raspberry Pi and Arduino. It is amazing what you can do with these tiny bits of technology and I was very impressed.

Now I am thinking what mini project could I play around with and which piece of hardware should I base it on. I don’t know much about the two platforms yet but I have found a [blog](http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-arduino-and-raspberry-pi) post that introduces the two. My current thoughts are to start with the Raspberry Pi, it is a UK technology and it uses a linux OS (which I have some knowledge of).

Being a windows developer, most of my programming knowledge is with C# and Visual Studio. To use my existing knowledge I could install and use MONO, which means I can program the Raspberry Pi using C# (see [here](http://logicalgenetics.com/raspberry-pi-and-mono-hello-world/) for more details about MONO on Raspberry Pi).

But deciding on a language to use, doesn’t help me choose a project. I haven’t even got myself a Raspberry Pi yet so I may decide more once I have had a play around with it. Thoughts so far include getting wi-fi to work on the Raspberry Pi or maybe adding a camera and sticking it somewhere and taking pictures, maybe even build myself a baby monitor (might go down well with the wife if its baby related)
