Microsoft are releasing a new operating system on July 29th called Windows 10.

If you have questions about Windows 10 watch this video by [Scott Hansleman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/Windows10IsComingheresWhatToTellNontechnicalParent.aspx). He explains how to upgrade from Windows 7 and 8 to Windows 10 and what to expect after you upgrade.

My advice to everyone is that you backup your devices before you upgrade, this is good practice before you install any software or updates.

Microsoft are offering Windows 10 for free for a whole year, so don’t panic. Take your time, backup all your important files and when you are ready install Windows 10. Nothing is going to stop working after July 29th if you don’t have the latest operating system on your machine.

I hope this helps answer some of your questions about what to do at the end of the month. If not feel free to write a comment or contact me with your questions.
