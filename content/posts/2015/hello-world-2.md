The first program anyone writes in a new language is often really simple and just displays the text “Hello World!”, below are a few examples from languages I have knowledge of.

```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
```

```HTML
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<p>Hello, world!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

```PHP
php echo 'Hello, world!'; ?>
```

```
MsgBox("Hello, World!")
```

```SQL
SELECT 'Hello, world!'
```
Or maybe 
```SQL
SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = 'Hello World!'
```

```PowerShell
'Hello, world!'
```

```JavaScript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

```BASIC
PRINT "Hello, world!"
```

Turns out I know quite a few programming languages. And yes there have been times where I need to stop and think about which language I am writing in.
