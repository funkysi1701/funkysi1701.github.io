My latest podcast can be found https://www.trekmate.org.uk/the-hunted-tng-s3-e11-the-battle-bridge/ and feedback can be left on the trekmate forums https://forum.trekmatefamily.com/2015/10/the-hunted-tng-s3-e11-review-the-battle-bridge/

While the Enterprise-D is reviewing a seemingly idyllic planet’s application for Federation membership, an escaped prisoner leads its crew to discover an ugly secret: the government’s shameful treatment of its war veterans.

Today James and Lou discuss (The Hunted) and what we think of it and much more as well as listener feedback with tonight’s guest host Simon.
