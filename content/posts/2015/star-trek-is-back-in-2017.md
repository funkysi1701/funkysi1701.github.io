As you have probably heard Star Trek is coming back to TV. I recently joined with the Sci Fi Waffle podcast to discuss.

Sci Fi Waffle: Episode 12 â€“ STAR TREK IS BACK!!

In this episode we discuss the great news that Star Trek IS BACK!!.

Shawn and I are joined again by James Roberts and TrekMates News feed Editor Simon Foster to speculate about the announcement of a new Star Trek TV series due to debut in January 2017.

James can be found on our sister podcast [The Battle Bridge](http://www.trekmate.org.uk/category/the-battle-bridge/) and Simon can be found on Twitter [@funkysi1701](https://twitter.com/funkysi1701)
