It is that time of year again, time to reflect on the year that has passed and look forward to the year ahead. As with many years 2024 has been a mixed bag, some good stuff, and some not so good stuff. I did not make any goals at the start of 2024, but I am going to fix that for 2025.

Goals for 2025

- Blog Posts
- More learning 
- Drink more water and do more walks
- Conferences and User Groups

## Blog Posts

For most of the year I have **not** been writing blog posts, however the Scottish Summit conference reignited my blogging spark and I have 7 posts written since then. My goal is to write one a week, I am sure I will miss the odd week, but the important thing is not to miss two in a row.

## More learning

Being a developer is a constant journey of learning, and I have not done enough of that this year. During December I have done a few of the challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and I hope to do more of them. I have also discovered [https://exercism.org/](https://exercism.org/) and I have started working through the C# track. I am sure there will be more opportunities to learn new things in 2025.

## Health

2024 took an unusual turn, In June I walked a [half marathon across the Peak District](/charity-hike), and since then I have been doing lots of walks. Walking is good for my health and my mental health so I intend to do lots more of it in 2025. I have a 5k scheduled for January which should be lots of fun as it is around the wildlife park. On the same topic I want to drink more water. Not sure how I am going to accomplish this as I am easily distracted by the current developer problem, instead of thinking about my health.

## Conferences and User Groups

I want to attend a Conference or User Group once a month in 2025. Conferences and User Groups are great places to meet people, learn new things and be encouraged by the community. I have signed up as a volunteer for NDC London in January, DDD North is back in February. I am sure I will be able to fill the other months with events soon enough as well. 

## What happened in 2024

I did something in 2024 that I thought I would never do. I signed up for a half marathon hike across the peak district for charity. This was an amazing achievement for me, and involved lots of training walks and also raised over Â£600 for charity.

My attendance of conferences and user groups has been a bit light this year, however I did attend Scottish Summit in October which rekindled my blogging. I also attended DDD North with a couple of my work colleagues which was great as usual. 

Family life has kept me busy this year and has been my focus for a lot of the year, next year I want the focus to shift more to my work and career. I attended a couple of code club sessions with my eldest son, and it was great to see his skills develop and like me he wanted to help others.
