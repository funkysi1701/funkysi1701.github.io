Kubernettes or k8s is all the rage at the moment for running all sorts of distributed systems. I know very little about it, I have touched on it in my work a few times, however I want to learn more.

All the cloud computing providers have managed k8s services, so I could create a k8s cluster on one of those. But the cost of these quickly adds up.

Raspberry Pi's are cheap small computers that I have played about with in the [past](/tags/raspberry-pi/)
