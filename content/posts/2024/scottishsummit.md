Scottish Summit 2024 took place in Aberdeen on the 18th and 19th October 2024 at the P&J Live Arena and I was there.

I travelled up to Aberdeen by train on the 17th October, travel took a good 6 hours, but I used the time to catch up on podcasts and audiobooks.

## Friday

Friday 18th was the first full day of the conference. As expected there were bag pipers at the door of the venue, back in 2022 they did this as well, reminding us all that it was a Scottish conference. Registration was quick and easy just show your QR code ticket and get a lanyard. This years lanyard were made of seed paper, so you could plant them and grow flowers, something I want to do in the spring. 

Scott Hanselman was the keynote speaker, and I spotted him in the main hall mingling with other attendees. I almost asked him for a selfie, but didn't in the end. His keynote was titled "AI: Hero or Villain" and was very interesting. He talked about ChatGPT in general terms and how it wasn't magic, but was just machine learning and used mathematics to predict the next word in a sentence. 

Next up was MVP Vesa Nopanen with his talk "Supercharge your Teams meetings". I picked up a few tips for improving my own Teams meetings. Adding notes and agendas to meetings was my bigest take away.

Next I attended a talk by a couple of the Scottish Summit organisers, they talked about the technology used to run an event like Scottish Summit. ()[Image goes here] Stripe was the payment API, and this linked in with a lot of Power Automate and Power Pages, this was very interesting as a charity non profit event, the tech used was very much lets learn how it works while also doing the job and not costing the earth.

What does it mean to be a modern full stack software developer? was a talk about how to mix power apps with traditional web development, this was interesting as I have not touched power apps before. Instead of starting with .net and trying to incorporate power apps, start with power apps and anything it can't do fill in with .net or traditional web development.

Next was a session about public speaking. I have never given a talk at a conference, but I feel I may do in the future. Hearing about how others have made that journey was very encouraging and has given me things to think about.

The last session of Friday was from MS Sarah Lean, she talked about how her hobbies (in her case Curling) influenced her work life. Another talk that left me with stuff to ponder. What hobbies do I have that could influence my work life?

For the friday evening there was a drag cabaret. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. Some very brave community speakers also got dressed up and took part in the show. This was all for the conferences charity TIE
