Scottish Summit 2024 took place in Aberdeen on the 18th and 19th October 2024 at the P&J Live Arena and I was there.

I travelled up to Aberdeen by train on the 17th October, travel took a good 6 hours, but I used the time to catch up on podcasts and audiobooks.

## Friday

Friday 18th was the first full day of the conference. As expected there were bag pipers at the door of the venue, back in 2022 they did this as well, reminding us all that it was a Scottish conference. Registration was quick and easy just show your QR code ticket and get a lanyard. This years lanyard were made of seed paper, so you could plant them and grow flowers, something I want to do in the spring. 

Scott Hanselman was the keynote speaker, and I spotted him in the main hall mingling with other attendees. I almost asked him for a selfie, but didn't in the end. His keynote was titled "AI: Hero or Villain" and was very interesting. He talked about ChatGPT in general terms and how it wasn't magic, but was just machine learning and used mathematics to predict the next word in a sentence. 

Next up was MVP Vesa Nopanen with his talk "Supercharge your Teams meetings". I picked up a few tips for improving my own Teams meetings. Adding notes and agendas to meetings was my bigest take away.

Stripe was the payment API, and this linked in with a lot of Power Automate and Power Pages, this was very interesting as a charity non profit event, the tech used was very much lets learn how it works while also doing the job and not costing the earth.

What does it mean to be a modern full stack software developer? was a talk about how to mix power apps with traditional web development, this was interesting as I have not touched power apps before. Instead of starting with .net and trying to incorporate power apps, start with power apps and anything it can't do fill in with .net or traditional web development.

Next was a session about public speaking. I have never given a talk at a conference, but I feel I may do in the future. Hearing about how others have made that journey was very encouraging and has given me things to think about.

The last session of Friday was from MS Sarah Lean, she talked about how her hobbies (in her case Curling) influenced her work life. Another talk that left me with stuff to ponder. What hobbies do I have that could influence my work life?

For the friday evening there was a drag cabaret. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. Some very brave community speakers also got dressed up and took part in the show. This was all for the conferences charity TIE

## Saturday

Saturday started with a trip to the world of wizards and D&D (Dungeons and Dragons). Securing the Realm and Autonomous Adventure: DM-less D&D with Azure AI. This was a really interesting practical talk about how you could use AI to run a D&D game, what guard rails to include and what AI prompts to use.

Community - It just makes sense was a talk about the tech community and how it can help you in your career. I feel I have only really dipped my toe into the community aspect, but after this weekend I am wanting to do more.

Sarah Lean (from Microsoft) talked about KQL or Kusto Query Language. KQL is the language that Application Insights uses to query data, I have touched on it a couple of times but interesting to learn more.

Ask the Azure experts panel was a great session, a bunch of 4 Azure MVPs and Sarah Lean from Microoft answered questions about Azure, how to migrate work loads, how to keep costs down and a few other tips.

Who's Affraid of a little ole copilot with Dona Sarkar and friends was a fascinating talk about how Copilots work in the Microsoft world. It featured many of the other speakers I had heard over the conference interacting as various services and tools. eg Purview, Copilot Prompt, Sharepoint, MS Teams, Outlook and of course the Responsible AI. This was a very fun way to end the conference and explain how the services interact.  

Lastly on the Saturday night was the pub quiz and UK Community Awards ceremony. It was great seeing members of the community that has worked so hard get recognition. The pub quiz was great fun, MVP Vesa Nopanen was our team captain and out team "Vogan Poets" came 14th and most of our team wore silly hats. It was great to socialise with my team mates and was one of the hilights of the conference.

## Conclusion

To sum up, Scottish Summit 2024 was a great conference and was super well organised. As a dotnet developer there was not a huge amount of relevant sessions for me. However the best thing about the conference is the community, I was able to hang out with a few MVPs and community people that I have met before and due to the pub quiz I was able to meet some new ones.

I left feeling really encouraged to get more involved in community and events like this. The talks on public speaking, community and hobbies were all about more soft skills than tech but these skills are so valuable in the tech world. 

Also I met Scott Hansleman (or at least saw him from the audience) so that was very cool.
