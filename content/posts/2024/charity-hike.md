## So why am I doing this? ##

I am a Software Developer in my day to day life, which does not involve a lot of physical activity. I have become very lazy. Doing a half marathon is completely outside of my comfort zone and is not at all a me thing to do.

However last year I realised my mental health was starting to degrade. I have a family which keeps me very busy, I am facing lots of challenges with this, other members of my family have mental health issues which is starting to have a knock on affect on me.

I mentioned some of these challenges to a friend who suggested I join a walking group which was helping people with mental health problems. I went along and to my surprise I really enjoyed myself, the people were friendly and I enjoyed the walk in the countryside. After this I went out and bought some proper walking shoes

I went to the next one, and the next one and each time I enjoyed myself. I must admit that after these walks it tired me out due to my unfit nature, but it was worth it as for a few hours I wasn't thinking about the 101 problems that I had no solutions for.

Fast forward to about a week ago, an advert for this charity walk popped up on facebook. I took a look at it and I started thinking. The 10k was a similar distance I had done on one of my walks, so I could easily do that. What if I could raise some money for a charity and go for a fun walk? For the next few days I kept thinking about it. Eventually I booked it. My thinking was if I am going to do something for charity I need to push myself outside of my comfort zone. I would never manage a full marathon, but what about a half marathon?

So tomorrow I start training, every day or so I walk for about 40 minutes, I will probably post some updates on my [charity page](https://fundraise.cancerresearchuk.org/page/funkysi1701) as no doubt I will struggle to keep going.

Please if you can think about donating, and give me some encouragement I think I am going to need it.
