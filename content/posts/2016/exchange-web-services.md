Where I work we use a really old fashioned way of recording where in the country employees are: Excel!

For years I have been trying to persuade staff to use calendars in Exchange. Outlook is great for looking at one or two peopleâ€™s calendars at once but quickly gets unmanageable for looking at ten or more peoples availability.

Recently I have started looking into how easy it is to query this information to give a custom view.

Microsoft provide an API to query exchange information called Exchange Web Services or EWS. I have only used EWS with my Exchange 2010 setup, but the documentation mentions working with Exchange 2007 and older or Exchange online.

Here are the basics of what I have tried. Fire up Visual Studio and from nuget install EWS.

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices
```

I started off with a simple Console App to see how it all worked, and then extended it to a MVC website. I found querying exchange directly was slow, but it is easy enough to cache information in a database.

To start you need to create an Exchange Service object, by specifying the version of Exchange you are using.

```csharp
ExchangeService service = new ExchangeService(ExchangeVersion.Exchange2010);
```

Next you need to pass the URL you are using to access Exchange.

```csharp
service.Url = new Uri("mail.example.com");
```

To access information from exchange you need to pass some Exchange credentials, ideally a username and password that has access to view all the calendars you want to look at.

```csharp
service.Credentials = new WebCredentials("username","password");
```

Next pass the email address of the user who owns the calendar you want to look at.

```csharp
service.ImpersonatedUserId = new ImpersonatedUserId(ConnectingIdType.SmtpAddress, "me@example.com");
```

My particular exchange server has a self signed SSL certificate which is not going to be trusted by remote clients.  The following line ignores this validation check and makes my program connect.

```csharp
System.Net.ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = (sender, certificate, chain, sslPolicyErrors) => true;
```

Now that we have connected to exchange we just need a few lines to look for events in the calendars.

```csharp
// Initialize the calendar folder object with only the folder ID.
CalendarFolder calendar = CalendarFolder.Bind(service, WellKnownFolderName.Calendar, new PropertySet());

// Set the start and end time and number of appointments to retrieve.
CalendarView cView = new CalendarView(startDate, endDate);

// Limit the properties returned to the appointment's subject, start time, and end time.
cView.PropertySet = new PropertySet(AppointmentSchema.Subject, AppointmentSchema.Start, AppointmentSchema.End);

// Retrieve a collection of appointments by using the calendar view.
FindItemsResults<Appointment> appointments = calendar.FindAppointments(cView);
```

Now that you have an appointments object you can loop through each element with a foreach loop. In my case I assign each elements Subject to a variable, which I can then do what I like with (display in a console window, save to a database, display in an MVC website.)

```csharp
foreach (Appointment a in appointments)
{
    if (a.Subject != null)
    {
        subject += a.Subject.ToString();
    }
}
```
My website queries a SQL database which I can easily populate with a console app that runs at regular intervals throughout the day.

There is a lot more I want to do with this project as this is only the basics of what you can do with Exchange Web Services. So expect more blog posts on this subject as I expand its functionality and learn new ways of doing things.
