The next exam I want to study for is the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate.

This is what [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) has to say about the exam.

The exam is due to change at the end of August 2022, but from the sound of it the change is just to keep it in line with AWS services and current best practice.

The recommendation for this exam is to have one year or more of hands on experience. I don't have this. However I have lots of years experience using Azure in a similar capacity, and a good 6 months or so using AWS. So we will see as I study and prepare if this is going to be a problem.
