I use keyboard shortcuts all the time, mostly without thinking, but they can be quite a time saver especially for frequently used tasks.

I recently came across this list of Visual Studio ones. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/default-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2022](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/default-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2022)

I was going to do a top ten, but not really sure how you rank keyboard shortcuts, so instead I will mention some of my favourites.

## Build solution

If you are using Visual Studio you need to build your code. If you are anything like me, after even the smallest change I want to see what affect that has had so a rebuild is often needed.

- Ctrl + Shift + B / Build Solution
- F5 / Run
- Ctrl + F5 / Run with no debugging

## Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo

Programming is sometimes refered to as copying and pasting from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but they are always times you want to copy and paste stuff so the standard keyboard shortcuts are all here.

- Ctrl + C / Copy
- Ctrl + X / Cut
- Ctrl + V / Paste
- Ctrl + Z / Undo
- Ctrl + Y / Redo (or Undo your Undo)

## Comments in your code

Often we like to temporarily comment out a line of code to see what affect it has. 

- Ctrl + K, Ctrl + C / Comment selection
- Ctrl + K, Ctrl + U /Uncomment selection

## Using statements

I like to keep my using statements tidy, and not clutered up with ones that aren't used anymore.

- Ctrl + R, Ctrl + G / Remove and Sort Usings

## Go to Implementation

I like to move quickly between methods that a class is calling to find out what is happening so the go to implementation and go to definition shortcuts are very useful. I tend to use the right click option more than the sortcut, but I would save myself a heap of time if I learnt these shortcuts.

- F12 / Go to Definition
- Alt + F12 / Peek Definition
- Ctrl + F12 / Go to Implementation

## Find file in Solution Explorer

You are editing a file and you have no idea what folder it is in the Solution Explorer. There is a shortcut to find out where you are.

Ctrl + [, S / Select Active File in Solution Explorer

## Search

Finding references or a certain string is a common activity

- Ctrl + F / Find in current file
- Ctrl + H / Replace
- Ctrl + Shift + F / Find in all files

## Visual Studio tries to be helpful

Often Visual Studio will try and be helpful with a lightbulb or similar icon, instead of clicking you can press this shortcut to 

- Ctrl + . / Show Visual Studio suggestion

As I said before keyboard shortcuts are great time savers. Go check out the complete list and share with me the ones you found most useful.
