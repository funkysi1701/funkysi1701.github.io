At the end of 2021 I got hold of my very first computer the [Lynx](https://www.funkysi1701.com/posts/back-to-basic/) from 30 years ago and have been playing about with simple BASIC coding.

I now have a collection of 27 cassette tapes with various programs saved on them. Back in 1985 programs were saved on cassette tapes as disk drives back then were very expensive.

No idea how many will work, but very curious to look at the code on them, some of the code was written by my father!</p>&mdash; Simon Foster (@funkysi1701) <a href="https://twitter.com/funkysi1701/status/1521179174551138306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

My father is not a software programmer but he spent a lot of time learning how to program the Lynx in the early 80s, and wrote various programs as educational tools for me and my sister. I am very interested in having a look at this code, and if possible preserving it. I have setup a github repo [here](https://github.com/funkysi1701/lynx) as a destination for this code. 

I don't have a cassette player to use however a bit of research has revealed [this](https://camputerslynx.blogspot.com/2017/05/recording-tapes-to-pc-using-audacity.html?m=1) as a possible process for playing back these tapes  to see what is on them.

I have now purchased this cassette player from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B085VLL74Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) It allows a USB connection to your cassette tapes. A quick test with an audio cassette has revealed it works, audio from the cassette is playable on my laptop and I can use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/windows/) to export to mp3 or other audio formats.

Croping the section of audio that contains the program is hard. So far all the tapes I have tried have resulted in no program found. 

A bit more progress now I have the Filename loaded from tape but getting incorrect length. Not sure what that means.
