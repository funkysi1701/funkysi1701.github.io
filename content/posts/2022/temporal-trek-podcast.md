Earlier this year I was a guest on the Temporal Trek Podcast. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your Inquiry is recognised.<br>Here is this weeks episode of The Temporal Trek.<br>“Dead Stop” part 2 of the unofficial Battle Damage two parter.<br><br>Special Guest <a href="https://twitter.com/funkysi1701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@funkysi1701</a> who was paid with three containers of warp plasma.

Here is the episode I recorded: 
[Temporal Trek Podcast Season 3 episode 30 Dead Stop](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-temporal-trek-podcast-season-3-episode-30-dead/id1499160640?i=1000554428633)

This week "Dan Dan" are joined by long time friend of the show, formerly from The Ten Forward Podcast, Simon Foster.

We discuss whether this is 

- A part two of a two-parter, last of a four parter or a previosuly unseen part 5 to the Tessek Prime Quintology?
- Rogue full-AI or just a really super advanced computer?
- Station seen again in Voyager?

Oh and by the way has anyone seen the guy who flies the ship, you know the one, tall bloke, loves a good prank, Space Boomer, answers to 'Travis'?

It was great fun to record and I hope you enjoy giving it a listen.
