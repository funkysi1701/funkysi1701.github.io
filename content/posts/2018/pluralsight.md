Earlier this year I signed up for pluralsight. If you want to sign up to pluralsight as well use this link [http://referral.pluralsight.com/mQd8BJ4](http://referral.pluralsight.com/mQd8BJ4) to get money off.

Pluralsight is a website that sells training videos on a wide variety of technical topics. You sign up for a monthly or annual subscription and you can watch over 6000 courses whenever and where ever you like.

I am not a big fan of videos as if I am sat in front of a screen I would rather be building something, however I do spend a lot of time listening to podcasts. So I have decided to convert this time to listening to pluralsight videos.

If we assume that by not seeing the visual portion of the videos you lose out on 75% of the learning (This is just a guesstimate I am not sure what the exact figure is or how you would calculate it). However this is still 25% more learning than if I hadn’t signed up at all.

Since I signed up I have listened to over 27 hours of technical videos. These have covered topics like C#, Security, Xamarin, MVVM, Interfaces, Getting Involved and Clean architecture. The number one thing I have learnt is that there is a lot that I still don’t understand.

That said I would like to think that since starting to listen to pluralsight concepts have gone from being unknown unknowns (I don’t know about them and I don’t understand them) to known unknowns (I know about them but don’t yet fully understand them)

To keep track of your learning pluralsight has some tests which you can complete. I am particularly proud of my score on the Azure test which ranks me as an expert.

Why not check out what you can learn from pluralsight?
