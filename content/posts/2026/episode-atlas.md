I am a big fan of Star Trek. I like to rewatch all the TV shows and the movies. However Star Trek has been going for 60 years, and there are now 961 episodes. It is a big job keeping track of when I last watched any particular episode.

To help solve this problem I have started building [Episode Atlas](https://www.episodeatlas.com/Episodes/). Episode Atlas is a web application which lists all 961 episodes, across 13 different TV Shows and the movies. You can also login (via Github or Microsoft auth) and track when you watch any particular episode.

It is very much a work in progress at the moment, I plan to add some fun stats and charts, and other features.
