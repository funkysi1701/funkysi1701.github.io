NDC London is one of the biggest software developer conferences and I was lucky enough to be on the volunteer team. This was my second time serving on the team, to read about my first time do check out my [2025 report](/posts/2025/volunteering-at-ndc/). The volunteer experience was very similar to last year, all the volunteers I worked with were awesome. I will concentrate this blog post on the talks and some of the takeaways I got from them.

I said this last year, but serving on team gave me a **super power**, more confidence to speak with other team members, speakers, vendors and others. Networking with your peers is such a valuable thing, so it was great to be able to take advantage of this.

## Wednesday

Due to helping hand out hoodies at reception for hundreds of attendees, I did not attend the keynote so my first talk was: **Let's break some WCAG rules** by *Elise Kristiansen*. This was a look at how so many websites break WCAG rules. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is a list of guidelines to help make websites as accessible as possible. WCAG has three different criteria:

- A - the bare minimum requirement
- AA - the legal requirement
- AAA - the highest level, not a requirement but a goal

15 - 25% of us have some form of disability, this can be permanent, temporary or situational. 94.8% of websites have a WCAG AA error somewhere in their content and are actually breaking the law.

Elise went through many of the criteria for WCAG and illustrated how we are excluding people by not considering various elements. One effective illustration was a colour blind number that only people that are colour blind could see.

The key takeaways from this talk:

- consider WCAG rules more carefully
- don't use <div> for everything, HTML is a rich language
- consider learning to use a screen reader

Next was **Social Engineering: Hacking Humans** by *Pawel Sucholbiak* as soon as you introduce a human element you run the risk of allowing social engineering.

**Supercharged Testing: AI-Powered Workflows with Playwright + MCP** by *Debbie O'Brien*

I had heard about the playwright MCP on .Net Rocks, but this was a great demo of how AI can help with testing.

The key takeaways from this talk:

- Give the playwright MCP a try

**The Undersea Cable Network** by *Richard Campbell*

A fascinating look at the history of undersea cables, along with the issues when these cables get damaged.

**Java Sucks (So C# Didn't Have To)** by *Adele Carpenter*

An interesting look at the history of Java, and the problems popularity caused in changing any initial design decisions.
