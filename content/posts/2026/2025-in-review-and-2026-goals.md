## 2025 in Review

What a year 2025 has been! I published 24 blog posts covering a wide range of topics from cloud-native technologies to AI experiments, and even some personal reflections. Here are the key themes and highlights from my blogging year:

### Cloud-Native and DevOps

This was a major focus area for me in 2025, not really surprising as I moved into a DevOps role this year, with deep dives into modern infrastructure:

- [**Learning Kubernetes**](/learning-kubernetes/) - Started my journey into container orchestration and shared my beginner experiences
- [**Deploying Hugo with Helm**](/deploying-hugo-with-helm/) - Deployed this very blog to Kubernetes using Helm charts
- [**Kubernetes and Let's Encrypt**](/kubernetes-and-letsencrypt/) - Tackled SSL certificate management in Kubernetes
- [**Monitoring with Nagios Docker**](/nagios-monitoring-with-docker/) - Explored monitoring solutions in containerized environments

### .NET and Development

My bread and butter continues to be .NET development, with several posts exploring new features and tools:

- [**Blazor and .NET 10**](/blazor-and-dotnet10/) - Covered breaking changes, fixes, and new features in the latest .NET release
- [**Adding Elasticsearch with .NET Aspire**](/adding-elasticsearch-with-aspire/) - Integrated search capabilities using Aspire
- [**Aspire 9.2**](/what-is-new-in-aspire-9.2/) - Explored the latest Aspire release
- [**NuGet Central Package Management**](/central-package-management-with-nuget/) - Streamlined dependency management
- [**What's New in C#**](/whats-new-csharp/) - Covered the latest language features
- [**Exceptions**](/exceptions/) - Best practices for error handling

### Observability and Monitoring

Understanding what's happening in production became a key theme:

- [**Getting Started with OpenTelemetry**](/getting-started-with-opentelemetry/) - Made observability easy with modern tracing
- [**OpenTelemetry Logs**](/adding-opentelemetry-logs-to-grafana/) - Extended observability to include logging
- [**Setting up Grafana**](/setting-up-grafana-for-monitoring-net-applications-with-docker/) - Built dashboards for monitoring

### Cloud Platforms

- [**Merging Two Projects into One**](/merge-two-projects-into-one/) - Shared my experience consolidating codebases

### AI and Creativity

- [**Fun with AI**](/fun-with-ai/) - Explored ChatGPT's image generation capabilities
- [**Using AI**](/using-ai/) - Practical applications of AI in daily work
- [**Mandelbrot Set**](/mandelbrot-set/) - A fun mathematical exploration

### Professional Development

- [**The Pragmatic Programmer**](/pragmatic-programmer/) - Book review of this classic software development book
- [**The Hacker Ethic**](/the-hacker-ethic/) - Reflections on developer culture and values
- [**Stepping Outside Your Comfort Zone**](/stepping-outside-my-comfort-zone/) - Personal growth and career development
- [**Volunteering at NDC London**](/volunteering-at-ndc-london/) - My experience at this major .NET conference
- [**Periodic Table of DevOps 2025**](/periodic-table-of-devops-15c7/) - A visual guide to the DevOps ecosystem

### Fun Projects

- [**Festive Naughty or Nice Checker**](/festive-naughty-or-nice-checker/) - A seasonal AI-powered fun project

Thank you to everyone who read, commented, and shared my posts throughout the year. Your engagement and feedback mean the world to me!

## 2025 by the Numbers

- **24 blog posts** published
- Major topics: Kubernetes, .NET, OpenTelemetry, AI
- New skills acquired: Helm, Kubernetes, observability tools
- Conferences attended: NDC London (as a volunteer) and DDD North
- Submitted content to [https://festivetechcalendar.com](https://festivetechcalendar.com)

## Goals for 2026

Looking ahead to 2026, I'm excited to build on this momentum. Here are my blogging and technical goals:

### Content Goals

- **Publish at least 24 posts** - Maintain the pace from 2025
- **Deep dive into AI/ML** - Go beyond experimentation to practical implementations
- **More hands-on tutorials** - Provide step-by-step guides that readers can follow along with

### Technical Skills

- **Master Kubernetes** - Move from beginner to intermediate proficiency
- **Advanced observability** - Implement comprehensive monitoring across distributed systems
- **Cloud-native patterns** - Explore microservices, event-driven architectures, and service mesh
- **AI integration** - Build practical AI-powered features into applications
- **Platform engineering** - Create better developer experiences and internal platforms

## Walking

At the end of 2024 I made the following goal:

```txt
2024 took an unusual turn. In June, I walked a half marathon across the Peak District, and since then, 
I have been doing lots of walks. Walking is good for my physical and mental health, 
so I intend to do more of it in 2025. I have a 5k scheduled for January, 
which should be lots of fun as it is around the wildlife park.
```

Well I enjoyed my walk in January 2025, which then led to two 10k walks (in July and September) and a 7.5k night walk (in Blackpool to see the Illuminations). This led me to explore [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/) and I completed my 8th run this morning. I say run, not walk as I am slowly becoming more of a runner and less of a walker.

So my goal here is to keep doing this, as I am so far enjoying getting out and about.

## What Would You Like to See?
