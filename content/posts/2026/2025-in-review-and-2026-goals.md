## 2025 in Review

What a year 2025 has been! I published 24 blog posts covering a wide range of topics from cloud-native technologies to AI experiments, and even some personal reflections. Here are the key themes and highlights from my blogging year:

### Cloud-Native and DevOps

This was a major focus area for me in 2025, with deep dives into modern infrastructure:

- [**Learning Kubernetes**](/learning-kubernetes/) - Started my journey into container orchestration and shared my beginner experiences
- [**Deploying Hugo with Helm**](/deploying-hugo-with-helm/) - Deployed this very blog to Kubernetes using Helm charts
- [**Kubernetes and Let's Encrypt**](/kubernetes-and-letsencrypt/) - Tackled SSL certificate management in Kubernetes
- [**Monitoring with Nagios Docker**](/nagios-monitoring-with-docker/) - Explored monitoring solutions in containerized environments

### .NET and Development

My bread and butter continues to be .NET development, with several posts exploring new features and tools:

- [**Blazor and .NET 10**](/blazor-and-dotnet10/) - Covered breaking changes, fixes, and new features in the latest .NET release
- [**Adding Elasticsearch with .NET Aspire**](/adding-elasticsearch-with-aspire/) - Integrated search capabilities using Aspire
- [**Aspire 9.2**](/what-is-new-in-aspire-9.2/) - Explored the latest Aspire release

- [**What's New in C#**](/whats-new-csharp/) - Covered the latest language features
- [**Exceptions**](/exceptions/) - Best practices for error handling

### Observability and Monitoring

Understanding what's happening in production became a key theme:

- [**Getting Started with OpenTelemetry**](/getting-started-with-opentelemetry/) - Made observability easy with modern tracing
- [**OpenTelemetry Logs**](/adding-opentelemetry-logs-to-grafana/) - Extended observability to include logging
- [**Setting up Grafana**](/setting-up-grafa-for-monitoring-net-applications-with-docker/) - Built dashboards for monitoring

### Cloud Platforms

- [**ACR vs ECR**](/acr-vs-ecr/) - Compared Azure and AWS container registries
- [**Merging Two Projects into One**](/merge-two-projects-into-one/) - Shared my experience consolidating codebases

### AI and Creativity

- [**Fun with AI**](/fun-with-ai/) - Explored ChatGPT's image generation capabilities
- [**Using AI**](/using-ai/) - Practical applications of AI in daily work
- [**Mandelbrot Set**](/mandelbrot-set/) - A fun mathematical exploration

### Professional Development

- [**The Pragmatic Programmer**](/pragmatic-programmer/) - Book review of this classic software development book
- [**The Hacker Ethic**](/the-hacker-ethic/) - Reflections on developer culture and values
- [**Stepping Outside Your Comfort Zone**](/stepping-outside-my-comfort-zone/) - Personal growth and career development
- [**Volunteering at NDC London**](/volunteering-at-ndc-london/) - My experience at this major .NET conference
