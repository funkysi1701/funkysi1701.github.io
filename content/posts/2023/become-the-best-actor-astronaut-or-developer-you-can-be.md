Recently I have been reading the first few chapters of Patrick Stwearts Memoirs. In it he tells the story of his early life. I find it fascinating that very early on it is quite clear he has a life goal. Become the best actor Patrick Stewart can be.

Yes, there are other things in his life but this is what motivates much of his decisions. At 12 he went on an 8 day residential drama course, where he met like minded people that encourage him. So much that he continued to meet with them years after that course finished to improve his skills as an actor. This led to him being involved in all sorts of amateur dramatic groups. 

After school he couldn't see a future in acting professionally so took a job at a newspaper.  However as soon as this job interferred with his acting, it allowed him to reasses his priorities and he began saving for drama school. Once at drama school he continues to improve his skills. He has a singular vision in these early years to become an actor, and within a few weeks of leaving his training he is working as an actor for a theatre. I have got upto the point where he is about to go on a world tour with a theatre group. His first few jobs he continues to work on his skills. There is no doubt in my mind that this sense of continuous improvement helped mold PS into the actor we know today.

A film I saw recently has a similar tale of a singular vision. A million miles away tells the story of a man that wanted to be an Astronaut and applied to NASA 12 times (he was rejected 11 times!) He started life as a migrant farm worker, so similar to PS, started out facing poverty. He did everything in his power to achieve his goals, and didn't give up.

So what's my point. Have a Big Goal. It can be anything but it needs to be big. My big goal of becoming a developer was achieved many years ago, and since then I have done a fair amount of drifting through life. What I need to do is be more like PS and continue to improve my skills, everyday make myself a better developer. What problems am I facing,  lets break them down into manageable goals and get them solved so i can move on to the next lot
