On Saturday 7th October I attended [DDD East Midlands](https://dddeastmidlands.com/). It is a community run conference for Developers (the D's stand for Developer) and I had a great time, I have been to DDD North before but this was the first time going to Nottingham for a conference (I grew up in Nottingham, or a town not far from). As I have said before there is nothing quite like chatting over coffee or lunch with fellow Developers about the tech you are learning about, this was probably my favourite thing about conferences. Now on to the talks:

## Dungeons, Dragons and Developers

[Matt Brunt](https://twitter.com/Brunty) gave an excellent keynote talk, comparing the role playing game Dungeons and Dragons with working on Software projects. A good D&D game involves team work, very like a good Software Team. A team of all wizards isn't going to get you very far, the same way a team full of developers that excel at algorithms, won't be good at testing, talking to customers etc. A wizard that has a secret spell to defeat the Troll under the bridge, is almost as bad as a developer that hordes his knowledge and "saves the day" when things go wrong.  Keeping connected with your team as you go out on your quest so no one gets lost is as important as keeping connected with your software team.

## Microservice Mistakes

[Matt Hunt](https://twitter.com/DoesDotNet) talked about microservice mistakes he had made.

1) Long lived small teams
2) Can't test by **only** interacting with the frontend
3) Use events as well as API calls
4) Need to be able to deploy independently of each other
5) Have a specific reason for using microservices, a problem to solve

## Building Robots for Complete Beginners

Last talk of the day was my favourite (because it was about Robots) [Mark Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark4security/) talked about building Robots using Rasbery Pi Pico (a microcontroller board), most of his examples used python.
