On Saturday 7th October I attended [DDD East Midlands](https://dddeastmidlands.com/). It is a community run conference for Developers (the D's stand for Developer) and I had a great time, I have been to DDD North before but this was the first time going to Nottingham for a conference (I grew up in Nottingham, or a town not far from). As I have said before there is nothing quite like chatting over coffee or lunch with fellow Developers about the tech you are learning about, this was probably my favourite thing about conferences. Now on to the talks:

#Dungeons, Dragons and Developers

#Microservice Mistakes

#The Art of the Bad Code Review

#Git Under the covers

#This talk could have been a blog post

#How to create the conditions where happy people do their best work

#Building Robots for Complete Beginners
