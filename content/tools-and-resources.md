## Affiliate & Referral Programs

I also recommend several services I personally use. 

## Octopus Energy

I have been with Octopus Energy for a few years now and have been very happy with the service. They have a range of tariffs to suit your needs and are very competitive on price. If you sign up using my referral link we both get £50 credit on our accounts.

I have also blogged about my experience with Octopus Energy [here](/posts/2021/charting-my-energy-usage-with-the-octopus-energy-api/).

## Connect Fibre

I struggled with slow internet for a while, so as soon as Fibre was available in my area I signed up. I have been very happy with the service and the speed. If you sign up using my referral link we both get £60 credit on our accounts.

## Mindful Chef

My diet is not great, so I signed up to Mindful Chef to get healthy meals delivered to my door. At first glance it looks expensive, but if you compare it to a takeaway, it is a similar price and with Mindful Chef you get a few healthy meals to cook, and no guilt that you have been naughty again! If you sign up using my referral link you will get 25% off your first four boxes.
