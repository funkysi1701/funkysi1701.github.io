## Parkrun

<img src="/images/2026/Parkrun.jpg" alt="parkrun" style="width:200px;height:auto;float:left;margin:0 1.5em 1em 0;" />

Parkrun is a free, weekly, community event offering 5km timed runs and walks in parks and open spaces around the world. It is open to everyone, regardless of age or ability, and is run entirely by volunteers. You can find your nearest event, register for a barcode, and view results at the official [parkrun website](https://www.parkrun.com/). For more information about how it works, visit the [parkrun UK page](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) or check out the [parkrun blog](https://blog.parkrun.com/).

I am new to parkrun and only started in 2025, below are the courses and times I have personally achieved, I will update this page as I go along with park runs and other runs or events.
