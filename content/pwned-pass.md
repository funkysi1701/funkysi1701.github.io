<p>Using the data supplied by Troy Hunt and his Have I been pwned? website Pwned Pass allows you to check to see if any password has appeared in a data breach.</p>
<p>For more details about Have I been pwned? check out <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> and <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com">www.troyhunt.com</a>.</p>
<p>Pwned Pass is a simple Xamarin app that allows you to type in a password and tells you if it has been used in a data breach.</p>
<p>Troy Hunt of <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned?</a> recently added a new API to his website which allows you to search his extensive database of pwned passwords, over 306 million of them. I have simply created a Android frontend to this API.</p>
<p>It should be noted:&nbsp;<strong>Do not send any password you actively use to a third-party service – even mine!</strong> I don’t log anything that you type into my app and this app makes use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/"><i>k</i>-anonymity</a> feature to avoid transmitting passwords.</p>
<p>As well as using Troy’s new API I also take advantage of his existing API’s. You can search his extensive database of email addresses to see if you have been affected by a data breach all from my android app.</p>
<p>My Pwned Passwords Android App is no longer available.</p>
