## Hey, I'm Simon Foster

My online persona is **Funky Si** — a nickname from university days that somehow stuck. I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building scalable, maintainable applications and robust DevOps practices.

With **18+ years** in IT departments (since 2006), I've worn many hats: software developer, systems administrator, infrastructure engineer, database specialist, and DevOps advocate. My career has evolved from traditional ops work into modern cloud-native development, and I genuinely enjoy the intersection of development and infrastructure.

### What I Do

I specialize in:

- **Backend Development**: .NET, C#, SQL Server, scalable API design
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Azure, AWS, Terraform, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), CI/CD automation
- **Architecture**: Designing systems that are secure, performant, and maintainable

## Community

- **Blogger** - 11+ years of writing about technology, DevOps practices, cloud architecture, and professional development on my blog
- **Tech Enthusiast** - Continuously learning and exploring emerging technologies like AI, Kubernetes, and observability

## Blog & Writing

- Cloud architecture and infrastructure as code
- .NET and C# development best practices
