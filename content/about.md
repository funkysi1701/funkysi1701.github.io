## Hey, I'm Simon Foster

My online persona is **Funky Si** — a nickname from university days that somehow stuck. I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building scalable, maintainable applications and robust DevOps practices.

With **18+ years** in IT departments (since 2006), I've worn many hats: software developer, systems administrator, infrastructure engineer, database specialist, and DevOps advocate. My career has evolved from traditional ops work into modern cloud-native development, and I genuinely enjoy the intersection of development and infrastructure.

### What I Do

I specialize in:

- **Backend Development**: .NET, C#, SQL Server, scalable API design
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Azure, AWS, Terraform, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), CI/CD automation
- **Architecture**: Designing systems that are secure, performant, and maintainable

## Recommendations

*Simon is an excellent developer, always looking for new methods and technology to improve existing solutions, along with his own skills. He is open to new ideas, though not afraid to share his thoughts and feedback and guide others to the best solution possible. It’s worth noting that Simon has vast knowledge on hardware and infrastructure which really does compliment his skill as a developer.*

*Simon worked for my company for a number of years and was a very valued member of staff, and later on management. He is an intelligent and conscientious worker who gives over and above on a regular basis. He leads by example and was respected by his peers and the directors of the company. I would not hesitate to recommend Simon both in terms of the quality of his work and his ethics and values in life in general.*

*If you want a developer who really understands DevOps, then Si is your man. With a mixture of operations, support, development and management experience, he can bring a balanced skillset to a team, as well as excellent knowledge of Azure, .NET, SQL and the web.*
