#What is Blazor?

Blazor is a way of writing .NET code that runs in the browser, so in theory no need for javascript. Check out [Blazor]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/client

#How it works

So what do you need to start? 

First thing is you need Visual Studio 2019 Preview and also the .NET core preview [SDK]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0 (at the time of writing this is preview 6). It is possible to use other versions of VS 2019, however I haven't tried this and there are additional configs steps needed to make this work.
