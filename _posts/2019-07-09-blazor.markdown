Blazor is a way of writing .NET code that runs in the browser, so in theory no need for javascript. Check out [Blazor][1] and other similar blogs.

# How it works

So what do you need to start? 

First thing is you need Visual Studio 2019 Preview and also the .NET core preview [SDK][2]  (at the time of writing this is preview 6). It is possible to use other versions of Visual Studio 2019, however I haven't tried this and there are additional configs steps needed to make this work.
